# Tidy Tuesday

Analyses of #tidytuesday datasets from https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday. My favorite plots are posted on my twitter @LizEisenhauer. I am using these datasets as an opportunity to get more familiar with the tidyverse and to begin incorporating git into my workflow.

I will definitely mess up often, as this is a work in progress..
